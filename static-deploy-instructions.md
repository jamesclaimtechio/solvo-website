# Static Deployment Instructions

Since Vercel is being problematic with Next.js detection, here are alternative deployment methods:

## Option 1: Netlify (Recommended)
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Connect repository: `jamesclaimtechio/solvo-website`
4. Build settings are auto-detected from `netlify.toml`
5. Deploy automatically

## Option 2: Manual Static Deploy
1. Download the `out/` folder contents
2. Upload to any static host:
   - Surge.sh: `npx surge out/`
   - Firebase Hosting
   - GitHub Pages
   - Any CDN

## Option 3: Fix Vercel (if needed)
The issue is Vercel detecting Next.js but expecting server files.
Current files work perfectly as static export locally.

## Files Ready:
- ✅ index.html (97KB)
- ✅ 404.html
- ✅ All assets in _next/
- ✅ Favicon and static assets
